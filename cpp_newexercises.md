### Exercise 1: Class Design

#### Problem:
Design a class `Book` that represents a book in a library. The class should have the following:
- Private members for the book's title, author, ISBN number, and price.
- A default constructor and a parameterized constructor.
- A destructor.
- A copy constructor.
- Overloaded assignment operator.
- Overloaded equality operator (`==`).
- A method to display the book's details.

#### Implementation Guide:
1. Define the `Book` class with the appropriate private members.
2. Implement the constructors, destructor, and methods.
3. Overload the assignment and equality operators.

### Exercise 2: Using Containers

#### Problem:
Create a program that manages a collection of books using a `std::vector`. Implement functions to add a book, remove a book by ISBN, and display all books.

### Exercise 3: fstreams (Input and Output)

#### Problem:
Create a program that reads book details from a file and writes the details of all books to another file. The input file contains book details in the format: title, author, ISBN, price (one book per line).

#### Implementation Guide:
1. Use `std::ifstream` to read from the input file.
2. Use `std::ofstream` to write to the output file.
3. Use a `std::vector` to store the books read from the file.

### Exercise 3: fstreams (Input and Output)

#### Problem:
Create a program that reads book details from a file and writes the details of all books to another file. The input file contains book details in the format: title, author, ISBN, price (one book per line).

#### Implementation Guide:
1. Use `std::ifstream` to read from the input file.
2. Use `std::ofstream` to write to the output file.
3. Use a `std::vector` to store the books read from the file.
